# Project's overview

In this project we're gonna create an AI that is able to play the famous Dino game from Chrome. Our smart dinosaurs will learn how to survive thanks to a genetic algorithm called N.E.A.T.

## Project's purposes

- train the AI over a simplified version of the game that has a single class of obstacles (cactus)
- once the AI gathers interesting results on this first game mode, we switch to a more tricky one with also flying obstacles, to test the capability of the AI to react to enviromental changes thanks to mutations and crossing-over
