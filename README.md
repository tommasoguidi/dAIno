# Project's overview

In this project we're gonna create an AI that is able to play the famous Dino game from Chrome. Our smart dinosaurs will learn how to survive thanks to a genetic algorithm called N.E.A.T.

## Project's purposes

- train the AI over a simplified version of the game that has a single class of obstacles (cactus)
- once the AI gathers interesting results on this first game mode, we switch to a more tricky one with also flying obstacles, to test the capability of the AI to react to enviromental changes thanks to mutations and crossing-over

###References

Special thanks to Code Bucket, our work is mainly based on his implementations of both the Dino game with pygame and the NEAT algorithm.

You can find his work on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_IfFmew4M6kgeo6yp18Nw). The related code is on Github in the repositories [ChromeDinosaur](https://github.com/codewmax/ChromeDinosaur) and [NEAT-ChromeDinosaur](https://github.com/codewmax/NEAT-ChromeDinosaur).
